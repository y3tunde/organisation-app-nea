# organisation-app-nea
A-level Computer Science NEA project exploring organisational app development, with emphasis on secure login and password hashing. Used python and SQL.

## What it does
- Allows users to create an account and log in
- Stores user data in SQL database
- Basic orginisational features (Priority to do list)

## Security features
- Passwords not stored in plain text
- Password hashing for login credentials

## What I learned
- Building authentication systems
- Common risks around log in systems and databases
- Global variables are bad :(

## Improvements to make
- include more orginisational features
- Improve hashing algorithm
- improve UI and make features more complete
